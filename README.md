# FARMA
FARMA is the Fusion Approach for Remotely-Sensed Mapping of Agriculture.

FARMA is a framework for efficiently merging VHR-derived objects with commonly available remotely-sensed imagery for time-series mapping and monitoring of agriculture at the field-scale across large geographical areas. FARMA allows the fusion of information from a wide range of image resolutions using distributed computing architecture where available. FARMA is built upon a number of Python packagaes including RSGISLib, Geopandas and Numpy.
